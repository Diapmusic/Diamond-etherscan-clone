:dog: This project is a simple demonstration of [etherscan](https://etherscan.io) dashboard.

This project used the [etherscan api](https://etherscan.io/apis) to get the ethereum blockchain data.

For the UI part, instead of basic html and css, we have used the fantastic [semantic-ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) library.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
